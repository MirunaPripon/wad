Bake Shop

Description:

This project consists of a web platform for our bakery shop store-chain.
The user requires an account in order to order products.
He can store multiple adresses for delivery. 
He can also edit these adresses, removing them in the process.

We have also devised an admin platform to add stores, tables 
in our shops and to validate or invalidate orders made by the customers.
