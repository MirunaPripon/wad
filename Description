Music Hosting Online Library

Description:

Let's assume a random user wants to listen online 
to his favorite music and decides to search 
for an optimal solution that can benefit him.
Our application let's the user engage in a free 
30-day trail that lets him browse our entire music catalogue 
and listen to his favorite artist or albums. 
When the trial expires, the user will be prompted to activate 
his paid subscription for which he will need to provide 
digital payment, via credit card, paypal or other means.
